# Diversity

## Intro Statement
- Combining technical expertise with diverse global perspectives
- Leveraging international backgrounds (aka Morocco + China) to build better software
- Committed to identifying and bridging our experience gaps

## Team Background
- **Yunling**: Roots in China, international student in Canada
- **Malek**: Roots in Morocco, moved to Canada for university
- **Global Reach**: Experience with Eastern Asian, North African, North American (but not too expereinced yet)
- **Languages**: Multilingual team with varied life experiences (Chinese, Arabic)

## Strengths & Weaknesses

### Strengths
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Java, C++, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Hardware**: PCB design, Arduino, 3D printing
- **Domain Knowledge**: AI/ML, NLP, Computer Vision, Applied Health Science
- **Psychology**: Understanding user behavior and cognition
- **Design Philosophy**: Focus on software-based solutions and automation

### Weaknesses (Gaps)
- Limited experience with long-term system maintenance
- Lack of hands-on telecom customer data exposure
- Unfamiliar with specific telecom regulations
- Limited experience designing for non-technical populations

## Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
- **MLOps Specialist**: For system reliability, monitoring, and scalability
- **Telecom Specialist**: Insights into real workflows and data constraints
- **Privacy/Compliance Expert**: Guidance on regulations and data protection
- **Cross-cultural UX Specialist**: To avoid cultural bias in design
- **AI Ethics Specialist**: To identify potential misuse or harm

## Diversity Gaps
- No lived experience with physical or sensory disabilities
- Limited exposure to older user demographics
- Limited representation of religious diversity
- Lack of experience with marginalized communities

## How this can impact us
- **Assumptions**: Risk of assuming all users are tech-savvy
- **Design**: Potential to overlook accessibility needs (visual/motor)
- **Communication**: Might miss cultural nuances in language support
- **Ethics**: Could underestimate risks for vulnerable user groups

## Value of Different Backgrounds
- Challenge our default technical assumptions
- Highlight accessibility barriers we might not see
- Ensure product relevance across different cultures
- Help navigate complex ethical and regulatory landscapes
